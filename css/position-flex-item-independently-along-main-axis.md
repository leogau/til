# Position Flex Item Independently Along Main Axis

If you apply auto margins to a flex item, that item will automatically extend its specified margin to occupy the extra space in the flex container, depending on the direction in which the auto-margin is applied.

For example: a `<div>` with `margin-left:auto` would be pushed all the way to the right of the flex container.

See source for examples.
